# OpenCV Basics â€“ Chapter-wise Practice

This repository contains chapter-wise Python scripts to practice fundamental concepts in computer vision using OpenCV. Each file demonstrates a specific topic, progressing from basic operations to shape and face detection.

## ðŸ“˜ Chapter Overview

- **Chapter 1** â€“ Read Images, Videos, and Webcam
- **Chapter 2** â€“ Basic Functions (Grayscale, Blur, Canny)
- **Chapter 3** â€“ Resizing and Cropping
- **Chapter 4** â€“ Drawing Shapes and Text on Images
- **Chapter 5** â€“ Warp Perspective
- **Chapter 6** â€“ Joining Images into Grids
- **Chapter 7** â€“ Color Detection using HSV
- **Chapter 8** â€“ Contours and Shape Detection
- **Chapter 9** â€“ Face Detection using Haar Cascades

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
